# spring-cloud-stream

By using Spring Cloud Stream we can develop applications where we do not need to specify the implementation details of the messaging system we want to use. 
We just need to specify the required binding dependencies and Spring Cloud Stream will the integrate the messaging systems to Spring Boot Application.

In this example, RabbitMQ is used but it can be replaced by any other messaging system without changing the code.
